<h2>Building from Sources</h2>

<p>Info on building is found <a href="here">http://github.com/squeryl/Squeryl</a></p>

<h2>Running the test suite</h2>

<p>Testing on H2 doesn't require you to setup a database, if you build with "SBT":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool you will have an "H2":http://www.h2database.com/ database ready to run the tests, and if the test succeds on H2, making it work on other DBs should be straight forward.</p>
